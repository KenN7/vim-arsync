# vim-arsync :octopus:
vim plugin for asynchronous synchronisation of remote files and local files using rsync

## Main features
- sync up or down project folder using rsync (with compression options etc. -> -avzhe ssh )
- ignore certains files or folder based on configuration file
- asynchronous operation
- project based configuration file
- auto sync up on file save
- works with ssh-keys (recommended) or plaintext password in config file

## Installation
### Dependencies
- rsync
- *vim8* or *neovim*
- sshpass (optional: only needed when using plaintext password in config file)


### Using vim-plug
Place this in your .vimrc:

```vim
Plug 'kenn7/vim-arsync'

" vim-arsync depedencies
Plug 'prabirshrestha/async.vim'
```
... then run the following in Vim:

```vim
:source %
:PlugInstall
```

### Using Packer

```lua
use {'kenn7/vim-arsync',
    requires = {
        {'prabirshrestha/async.vim'}
    }
}
```

... then run the following in Vim:

```vim
:source %
:PackerSync
``` 
    
### Configuration
Create a ```.vim-arsync``` file on the root of your project that contains the following:

```
remote_host     example.com
remote_user    john
remote_port    22
remote_passwd  secret 
remote_path     ~/temp/
local_path    /home/ken/temp/vuetest/
ignore_path     ["build/","test/"]
ignore_dotfiles 1
auto_sync_up    0
remote_or_local remote
sleep_before_sync 0
```

Required fields are:
- ```remote_host```     remote host to connect (must have ssh enabled)
- ```remote_path```     remote folder to be synced

Optional fields are:
- ```remote_user```    username to connect with
- ```remote_passwd```  password to connect with (requires sshpass) (needed if not using ssh-keys) 
- ```remote_port```    remote ssh port to connect to (default is 22)
- ```local_path```     local folder to be synced (defaults to folder of .vim-arsync)
- ```ignore_path```    list of ingored files/folders
- ```ignore_dotfiles``` set to 1 to not sync dotfiles (e.g. .vim-arsync)
- ```auto_sync_up```   set to 1 for activating automatic upload syncing on file save
- ```remote_or_local``` set to 'local' if you want to perform syncing localy
- ```sleep_before_sync```   set to x seconds if you want to sleep before sync(like compiling a file before syncing)
- ```local_options``` overrides the default rsync options for case where `remote_or_local` is local
- ```remote_options``` overrides the default rsync options for case where `remote_or_local` is remote

**NOTE:**
- fields can be commented out with ```#```
- rsync will receive the flags `-varze` for remote syncing and `-var` for local syncing by default. Any flags you set using `rsync_flags` will override these flags.
    
## Usage
If ```auto_sync_up``` is set to 1, the plugin will automatically launch the ```:ARsyncUP``` command
everytime a buffer is saved.

Setting ```rsync_flags``` to `-u -l`, for example, will use rsync's 'update' feature and will also copy over symlinks. Check out rsync's man page to see all the options it supports.

### Commands

- ```:ARshowConf``` shows detected configuration
- ```:ARsyncUp``` Syncs files up to the remote (upload local to remote)
- ```:ARsyncUpDelete``` Syncs files up to the remote (upload local to remote)
  and delete remote files not existing on local (be careful with that)
- ```:ARsyncDown``` Syncs files down from the remote (download remote to local)

Commands can be mapped to keyboard shortcuts enhance operations

## TODO

- [ ] run more tests
- [ ] deactivate auto sync on error
- [ ] better handle comments in conf file

## Acknowledgements

This plugin was inspired by [vim-hsftp](https://github.com/hesselbom/vim-hsftp) but vim-arsync offers more (rsync, ignore, async...).

This plugins uses the [async.vim](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/async.vim) library for async operation with vim and neovim.
